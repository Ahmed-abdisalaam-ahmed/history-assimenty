        <p>Due to the importance of the Shahada in Islam, regulations have been made on the usage of the flag. 
        It is forbidden for Somalis to fly the flag at half mast because it has the Shahada 
        (which reads in Arabic "There is no other god except God, Muhammad is the Messenger of God") 
        written on it, and it is seen as desecration. Moreover, if a person is seen lowering the flag to half-mast, they might
         be charged with flag desecration. Similar rules, for the same reason, 
         also apply to the flags of Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.</p>
